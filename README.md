# Survey App

This app is currently in development. It is built for Epicodus homework to explore implementation of Firestore/Firebase within a React app. The app also uses Redux to handle local state. Users can create surveys, view surveys, edit surveys, delete surveys, and take surveys. Firebase authentication/authorization is used to handle user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.
